# journey-to-fp
Slides and code from the talk "Journey to Functional Programming", given at Wix Engineering Conference

This talk is inspired by (and borrows from) a whole lot of great talks by the following people:

* [Purely Functional I/O](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/io-functional-side-effects) by [RÃºnar Bjarnason](https://twitter.com/runarorama)
* [A year living Freely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK53C-xyPWw) by [Chris Myers](https://twitter.com/cwmyers)
* [Drinking the Free Kool-Aid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4956GI-6Lw) by [David Hoyt](https://github.com/davidhoyt)

And lots of great info on Free monads (and FP in Scala in general) from various posts:
